## Ways of contributing

There are a few ways of contributing into the project:

1. Bug fixes
2. Check the [Issues page](https://github.com/ThanosFisherman/WifiUtils/issues) and resolve any issues you can find
3. Code refactor. There is huge room for improvement :)
4. Introduce any interesting functionality you might need. Please do let me know before doing this first. There might be a chance that a feature you might want to include be really specific to your needs and not fit the overall philosophy of the lib.

## Creating Pull Requests (PR)
In order to create a Pull Request

1. Fork the project.
2. Create a new branch from `master`.
3. Make any modifications required.
4. When done, open a PR of your new branch against `master`.

Make sure to consider testing the code you push.

Try not to create huge PRs. The bigger the PR, the less chances of it getting merged on time.

## Reporting Issues
In case you found a bug in the lib, or some bits in the code base that can cause issues, you can open an Issue so that someone can fix it. If it is a bug, make sure to write down all the steps it took to replicate it.
